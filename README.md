# The-Huddle
A simple Web-based Client Relationship Management application that uses back-end and front-end technologies. I created this as an ambitious second project for my General Assembly BootCamp.

## General Info
This is a simple CRM application that uses a Node server and MongoDB database to display various information to a small business about their client relations.  Features of this application include:
* Three different User Permission Levels
* Associated databases for easy relationship management
* Datatables and charts.js on the front-end for easy visual views of information
* Mobile-friendly design
